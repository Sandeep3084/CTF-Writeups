We are given the Python source code in the attachment:
```
import os
from Crypto.Util.number import bytes_to_long


def LFSR():
    state = bytes_to_long(os.urandom(8))
    while 1:
        yield state & 0xf
        for i in range(4):
            bit = (state ^ (state >> 1) ^ (state >> 3) ^ (state >> 4)) & 1  
            state = (state >> 1) | (bit << 63)


rng = LFSR()

n = 56

print(f"Let's play rock-paper-scissors! We'll give you {n} free games")
print("but after that you'll have to beat me 50 times in a row to win. Good luck!")
rps = ["rock", "paper", "scissors", "rock"]

nums = []
for i in range(n):
    choice = next(rng) % 3
    inp = input("Choose rock, paper, or scissors: ")
    if inp not in rps:
        print("Invalid choice")
        exit(0)
    if inp == rps[choice]:
        print("Tie!")
    elif rps.index(inp, 1) - 1 == choice:
        print("You win!")
    else:
        print("You lose!")

for i in range(50):
    choice = next(rng) % 3
    inp = input("Choose rock, paper, or scissors: ")
    if inp not in rps:
        print("Invalid choice")
        break
    if rps.index(inp, 1) - 1 != choice:
        print("Better luck next time!")
        break
    else:
        print("You win!")
else:
    print(open("flag.txt").read())
```
This is basically a rock paper scissors game using an LFSR (I still need to research more on this algorithm) but it basically is used to generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers that provide 56 rounds for us to play against the computer and we need to win 50 consecutive times to retrieve the flag.
What I understood was that the seed value(initial input) of the LFSR is randomised, so I thought giving a fixed seed value would make the LFSR predictable, and so GPT provided this modified code:
```
def FixedLFSR():
    # Use a fixed seed to make LFSR predictable
    state = 0b1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010
    while 1:
        yield state & 0xf
        for i in range(4):
            bit = (state ^ (state >> 1) ^ (state >> 3) ^ (state >> 4)) & 1
            state = (state >> 1) | (bit << 63)

def predict_next_choice(rng):
    return next(rng) % 3

rng = FixedLFSR()

n = 50  # Adjust the number of games as needed

print(f"Let's play rock-paper-scissors! You need to win {n} consecutive times.")
rps = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

for i in range(n):
    choice = next(rng) % 3
    inp = input("Choose rock, paper, or scissors: ")
    if inp not in rps:
        print("Invalid choice")
        exit(0)
    
    # Predict the next choice
    predicted_choice = predict_next_choice(rng)
    print(f"Predicted computer's next choice: {rps[predicted_choice]}")

    # Check if the player's input matches the predicted computer's choice
    if inp == rps[predicted_choice]:
        print("You win!")
    else:
        print("Try again. You need to win consecutively.")
        break
else:
    print("Congratulations! You won 50 consecutive times.")
    print(open("flag.txt").read())
```
But this approach did not work
